      <description>The first part of this post can be found Processing Real-Time Streams in Databricks – Part 1
This is the continuation of the part one, so we will not talk about the architecture and setup that is discussed in part 1.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I introduced Lambda architecture to process the stream and the batch data within the same stack. Critics argue that Lambda architecture needs the data to be processed twice, once during the speed layer and once in the batch layer.</description>

      <description>Distributed computing technology enables the compute load to be spread, or distributed, across multiple nodes (computers) connected via a network. The networked machines connected to each other share the same goal and share the compute load to effectively collaborate and provide the resources to obtain the goal.</description>
