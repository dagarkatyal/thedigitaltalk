Greeks are famous from many things. But first of the thing that comes in the mind when we hear "Greek" is the "Greek Architecture" and "Greek Alphabets" (i.e alpha beta gamma).

> Greek Architecture is the flowering of geometry

This about what will happen when we merge Greek alphabets to Greek architecture? No we do not get new buildings and physical architecture but we get state of the art Data Processing Architecture.

Following are the three popular Data processing architecure for big and small data on cloud. These cover various scenarios for both batch, realtime, small and big data. The links take to the dedicated blog for each architecture

## [Lambda Architecture:](https://www.thedigitaltalk.com/blog/2019-7-introduction-to-lambda-architecture)

[Based on the concept of Batch Layer, Speed Layer and Serving Layer](https://www.thedigitaltalk.com/blog/2019-7-introduction-to-lambda-architecture)

## [Kappa Architecture:](https://www.thedigitaltalk.com/blog/2019-7-kappa-architecture-another-way-of-data-processing)

[Based on the concept of processing data in Speed Layer only](https://www.thedigitaltalk.com/blog/2019-7-kappa-architecture-another-way-of-data-processing)

## [Delta Architecture:](https://www.thedigitaltalk.com/blog/2019-9-introduction-to-delta-architecture)

[Based on the plan of merging the batch and speed layer](https://www.thedigitaltalk.com/blog/2019-9-introduction-to-delta-architecture)
